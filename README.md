### Installations:
Anaconda enviroment with python 3.6 

### Motivation:
This project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. We need to pick a dataset, come up with some questions related to the data and answer them through a blogpost. Following are the questions.

Question 1. How to predict price of the new listing?
Question 2. What are the most important features driving the listing price?
Question 3. Which ML technique will be most suitable for the price detection based on the available data?

### Summary
I found that the top two main drivers for prices are Reviews per Month & number of people a listed property can accommodate. Availability in a year is also very important as well as no. of bedrooms, bathrooms & reviews.

XGBOOST algorithm predicted prices with Mean Absolute Error of 23 on the Test Data.

### Files:
The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted. A folder with the raw data and this readme file.
